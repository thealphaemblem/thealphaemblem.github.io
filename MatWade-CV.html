                        <p>As the IBM designated Solution Architect for the Output Management System (OMS), I was responsible for eliciting client requirements and turning them into a deliverable product which included a greenfield billing document. Achieved by engaging with stakeholders and developers often in 3 amigos and sometimes magnificent 7 format to get the product into production as soon as possible. After building the framework myself, I then handed over the completed requirements to the offshore team to continue with development and progress with the User Stories. The project was a multi-million-pound investment affecting all of npower’s 6 million plus customers over a 3-week transition period. Complicit in delivering many ad-hoc projects because of my analysis of system performance, suggesting process improvements, minor system enhancements and developing new tools to help with problem solving both reactive and proactive.</p>

            <h1>Personal Information</h1><hr/>
            <p id="personalInfo">Outside of a professional environment I like to cook, especially themed evenings such as Mexican or Tapas and my Yorkshire puddings are legendary not to mention my pies. Our family enjoys travelling, the US and Portugal are our favourites closely followed by Spain where I’m learning to speak the language a little. We have even appeared on Channel 4’s <a href="http://bit.ly/32e6K2u">Sun, Sea & Selling Houses</a> (S01E11)! When not on a plane, we like to travel to the coast and the Dales (usually the long way around) and go walking.
			I have also written a novel which has been published on <a href="https://amzn.to/2LH1deZ">Amazon</a> and currently still on sale! It’s a teen sci-fi dystopian thriller, a bit like Divergent, The Hunger Games, Maze Runner etc. Another hobby of mine is tinkering with new technology and <a href="http://bit.ly/2XKhWVt">software</a> such as Swift 3 and Xamarin. I have many ideas for releasing my own apps!
			We also enjoy going to the cinema and a good spot of American TV shows such as The Walking Dead, GoT and many more! Both my wife and I are proud parents of twin boys who arrived in May 2010.
