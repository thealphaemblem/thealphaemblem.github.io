                            <p>As the lead architect for the output management system (OMS), I had a varied role to play within the team. My main role was the Solutions Architect in which I was responsible for eliciting client requirements and turning them into a deliverable project by one of 4 SDLC approaches of Agile, Waterfall, Spiral and in some cases RAD.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>One such successful delivery was a new bill design and to transition all 6m customers to it. Jointly designed with the client, I extracted the BRD elements for our team and delivered several prototypes for refinement. Engaging with the data team to have the data fit to requirement, we managed to successfully transition the 6 million customers on to a new style bill over the course of a few weeks. During the transition phase, there were issues to resolve and we worked in a coordinated Agile approach for 4 weeks utilising sprints to resolve all backlogged items in priority order.</li>
                                <li>Another project submitted by me and accepted was a products catalogue for terms and conditions. The old process took 3-4 days to launch a new product as the T&amp;C’s for the new product had to be manually loaded into the system. I came up with an innovative solution using C# which could take a word document and read it into the system automatically making the product ready to market in under 20 minutes, smashing the client’s goal of a 24 hour SLA.</li>
                                <li>Other deliveries included:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A C# thick client to ingest data from a Unix server to the local Windows environment and perform ETL to SQL. This data was then queried by a lightweight HTML webpage using JS, jQuery, CSS and Bootstrap. This delivery was made using a Waterfall approach.</li>
                                    <li>Creation of a custom lookup file (C# .NET) that used 18m post codes from the Post Office which linked to a specific Distribution Office (DO) and linked in with an Energy UK Rota Disconnect file. This was used for all output in the system. The program also kept track of updates, deletions, changes with a full audit trail. This project was one of a few RAD deliveries ready from concept to production in 12 days. </li>
                                    <li>Creation of a “Quick Document Preview” system (SQL Backend, HTML Frontend) which allowed analysts to view customer documentation created in the latest batch run on screen. This helped with analysis of specific account types before the document go to the customer. This mimicked an archiving system where the PDF created was stored in a database along with account specific information. </li>

                <p id="personalInfo">Outside of a professional environment I like to cook, especially themed evenings such as Mexican or Tapas. Our family enjoys travelling, the US and Portugal are our favourites closely followed by Spain where I’m learning to speak the language a little. When not on a plane, we like to travel to the coast and the Dales (usually the long way around) and go walking.
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alpha-Emblem-Origin-Mathew-Wade-ebook/dp/B07JFNKRW2/">I have also written a novel which has been published on Amazon and currently still on sale!</a> It’s a teen sci-fi dystopian thriller, a bit like Divergent, The Hunger Games, Maze Runner etc. Another hobby of mine is tinkering with new technology and software such as Swift 3 and Xamarin. I have many ideas for releasing my own apps!
We also enjoy going to the cinema and a good spot of American TV shows such as The Walking Dead, GoT and many more! Both my wife and I are proud parents of twin boys who arrived in May 2010.
