                        <p>As the Solution Architect for the output management system (OMS), I was responsible for eliciting client requirements and turning them into a deliverable project by one of 4 SDLC approaches of Agile, Waterfall, Spiral and in some cases RAD. I delivered a green field project of a new billing document by engaging with the client to help build their requirements (BRD), advising on system limitations and work arounds. I also engaged with the data team to have the data from the source system delivered into my system in the most efficient format possible. After building the document framework myself, I then handed over the rest of the requirements to the offshore team to continue with development and enhancements. The project was a multimillion pound investment affecting all of npower’s 6 million plus end customers. I was also complicit in delivering many ad-hoc projects as a result of my analysis of the system performance, advising on process improvements, system enhancements and developing new tools to help with problem solving both reactive and proactive.</p>

            <h1>Personal Information</h1><hr/>
            <p id="personalInfo">Outside of a professional environment I like to cook, especially themed evenings such as Mexican or Tapas. Our family enjoys travelling, the US and Portugal are our favourites closely followed by Spain where I’m learning to speak the language a little. When not on a plane, we like to travel to the coast and the Dales (usually the long way around) and go walking.
                <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alpha-Emblem-Origin-Mathew-Wade-ebook/dp/B07JFNKRW2/">I have also written a novel which has been published on Amazon and currently still on sale!</a> It’s a teen sci-fi dystopian thriller, a bit like Divergent, The Hunger Games, Maze Runner etc. Another hobby of mine is tinkering with new technology and software such as Swift 3 and Xamarin. I have many ideas for releasing my own apps!
                We also enjoy going to the cinema and a good spot of American TV shows such as The Walking Dead, GoT and many more! Both my wife and I are proud parents of twin boys who arrived in May 2010.
