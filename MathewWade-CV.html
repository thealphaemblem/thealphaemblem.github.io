I have performed the following deliverables to the following clients:</p>

                    <li>QA to other work to ensure that all variations of correspondence are valid as per specification</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Provide guidance to offshore resources on the DOC1 toolset</li>

                            <p align="justify">I started my computing career at the Leeds Building Society (then the Leeds &amp; Holbeck BS) where I was part of a trial apprenticeship. This success story made its way into the Yorkshire Evening Post. After gaining several years of knowledge in that environment (ICL VME) I took to performing consultancy work around the country under my own company of SystemsGo! Services Ltd. I traded for about three years and worked for many prestigious companies such as ICL, BT, South West Water and Southern Water. I also supported many local businesses with server and network infrastructure setup and troubleshooting. I then brought all this experience to jmc in August 2001 working as a Systems Guardian. During this time, the department was TUPE&apos;d across to Accenture where I started as a Level G in April 2001. I then left the data centre to pursue a programming career after my “noddys” were noticed by the Application Management Lead. I was offered a position as DMS Application Programmer Level F where I soon progressed to Level E after delivering excellent results. Since that time I was promoted to Level D (DMS Service Lead) and took on a staff of 2, 1 programmer and 1 analyst. In October 2009, the DMS Team was TUPE&apos;d back to Thomas Cook, Support Services where I held the position of DMS Team Lead at RL5. I then left Thomas Cook to pursue a career with the company that made the software I enjoy using.</p>
